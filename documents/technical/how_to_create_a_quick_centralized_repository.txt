Quick and dirty, setting up a shared, central git repository for your team.

While this is a solution, a much better one would be to use github. Their public 
repositories are free and their private plans are really affordable and if you 
absolutely need a private repository, they have a firewall install version: 
http://fi.github.com/.

However, the following is free to set up. It'll likely may take you a little 
more time though.

For the website: my-project-name.com
For the company: my-company-name

1. On your git server, git.my-company-name.com (the centralised repository)
    #Create a neutral user (eg. central) and a bare repository 
        useradd -m central
        sudo su central -
        mkdir -p /home/central/dev/my-company-name
        cd /home/central/dev/my-company-name
        git clone --bare -o blank_altumo git://github.com/homer6/blank_altumo.git my-project-name.com.git

2. On Each Environment (Each Developers's personal Dev, shared Testing, shared Staging and shared Production)
    #Create a working directory for an environment
        git clone -o central ssh://central@git.my-company-name.com:22/home/central/dev/my-company-name/my-project-name.com.git

3. Add each user's public key to the
    ssh-keygen (generates a public key)
    copy that to each line in the ~/.ssh/authorized_hosts file
